# Language-Detection-Project
This project is a Language Detection Model that identifies the language of a given text input. It takes a userâ€™s statement or sentence and predicts which language it is written in using machine learning techniques.  The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
