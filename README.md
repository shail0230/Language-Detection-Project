# Language-Detection-Project
This project is a Language Detection Model that identifies the language of a given text input. It takes a user’s statement or sentence and predicts which language it is written in using machine learning techniques.  The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

#Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically detect the language of a text input.
Language detection is a common NLP task and forms the foundation for many real-world applications such as:
Translators (like Google Translate)

#Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – for numerical computations
scikit-learn (sklearn) – for building and evaluating machine learning models
